                <b>R</b>e:store Axe Valley CIC is a Seaton based, not for profit organisation supporting the local community to access and find help when needed.  If you want to visit us pop in to our community café at Seaton Hospital open Wednesday through to Saturday 9am – 5pm and open to community groups on Mondays and Tuesdays. <br/><br/>
                <b>E</b>stablished in 2020 we support the local Axe Valley community and individuals, helping to restore a balance where challenges of life have taken their toll. We are seeking to help restore lives to a place of flourishing, working towards the goal of people looking out for one another. <br/><br/>
                <b>S</b>olidifying what was established during the Covid-19 pandemic Re:store Axe Valley CIC emerged from the Seaton Coronavirus Community Group (SCCG), building on the fantastic help provided by volunteers, along with the community spirit that emerged. <br/><br/>
                <b>T</b>ogether with over 40 other local groups, businesses and charities we work to provide the assistance that might be needed. We are keen to signpost and prescribe social initiatives run by local organisations as well as our own projects to help reduce mental health issues and increase well-being in our community. <br/><br/>
                <b>O</b>ur aim is to bring a smile back to those who’ve been through challenging and difficult times, helping to connect, walk with or provide the help which is needed. <br/><br/>
                <b>R</b>elationships with our local community is integral to who we are and through numerous initiatives we have worked closely with local authorities, organisations, businesses and schools on projects providing support and services to the entire community. <br/><br/>
                <b>E</b>veryday life presents different struggles and problems for everyone and if we can continue to encourage a large percentage of the community to get involved in small ways then our reach becomes far greater and the friendships which are built will in many cases be the first step for people being restored. <br/><br/>
