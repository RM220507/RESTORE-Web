                    <b>R</b>e:store Axe Valley CIC is a Seaton based, not for profit
                    organisation supporting the local community to access and find
                    help when needed. If you want to visit us pop in to our
                    community caf√© at Seaton Hospital open Wednesday through to
                    Saturday 9am - 5pm and open to community groups on Mondays and
                    Tuesdays. <br /><br />
                    <b>E</b>stablished in 2020 we support the local Axe Valley
                    community and individuals, helping to restore a balance where
                    challenges of life have taken their toll. We are seeking to help
                    restore lives to a place of flourishing, working towards the
                    goal of people looking out for one another. <br /><br />
                    <b>S</b>olidifying what was established during the Covid-19
                    pandemic Re:store Axe Valley CIC emerged from the Seaton
                    Coronavirus Community Group (SCCG), building on the fantastic
                    help provided by volunteers, along with the community spirit
                    that emerged. <br /><br />
                    <b>T</b>ogether with over 40 other local groups, businesses and
                    charities we work to provide the assistance that might be
                    needed. We are keen to signpost and prescribe social initiatives
                    run by local organisations as well as our own projects to help
                    reduce mental health issues and increase well-being in our
                    community. <br /><br />
                    <b>O</b>ur aim is to bring a smile back to those who've been
                    through challenging and difficult times, helping to connect,
                    walk with or provide the help which is needed. <br /><br />
                    <b>R</b>elationships with our local community is integral to who
                    we are and through numerous initiatives we have worked closely
                    with local authorities, organisations, businesses and schools on
                    projects providing support and services to the entire community.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>E</b>veryday life presents different struggles and problems
                    for everyone and if we can continue to encourage a large
                    percentage of the community to get involved in small ways then
                    our reach becomes far greater and the friendships which are
                    built will in many cases be the first step for people being
                    restored. <br /><br />
