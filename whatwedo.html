                    closely with a number of groups offering a warm, comfortable

                    Come and see us in our community space at Seaton Hospital where, in partnership
                    with Waffle, you'll receive a warm welcome and can get a great coffee. <br/><br/>
                    On 7th June 2022, after permission was granted by NHS property services to re-purpose
                    the former kitchen at the hospital, the cafe and community hub opened based on a
                    similar concept to the successful Axminster Waffle House with the aim of combatting
                    loneliness and encouraging community cohesion. <br/><br/>
                    Every Monday and Tuesday Re:store oversee the community cafe using the space as a
                    meeting place for a variety of local groups and organisations, with a private meeting
                    room also available. <br/><br/>
                    If you are interested in booking or utilising the space please
                    <a href="mailto:info@restoreseaton.co.uk">email us</a> or take a look at the Facebook
                    pages for Re:Store and Waffle Seaton to find out more about local groups meeting there.</div>
